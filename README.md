- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dr-harper
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Energy and Smart Buildings. Most of my public repositories are written in R but mostly use Python for my work.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning tools for productionising my code, including the GCP platfor & Docker.
- ðŸ“« Chat on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-harper/) or [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/DrMichaelHarper). When I find time, I enjoy sharing bits on my [blog](https://mikeyharper.uk/) too.
